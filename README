To get your own copy of tradey:

cp config.py.template config.py -- fill out the fields inside appropriately.
cp -R data_template/* data/
cd data git init

You will need to add the admin user to user.xml manually. Below is a template. Replace <NAME> with the name of the admin user. Other users can be added with the !adduser command. Whisper !help !adduser to MM for instructions.

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<users>
    <user accesslevel="20" id="2000000" money="0" name="<NAME>" stalls="1" used_stalls="0"/>
</users>

You will need to create the character for the bot to use in the character clot listed in config.py. If you wish to test the bot you will need to log in with a different account than MM's character is on. Give the char the trading skill from the Trader npc and use '@zeny -45' to remove the remainder of the character's money. The character is now ready to be used by the bot. Move it to a convenient location, log off, and start MM.

Start MM with ./start.sh
